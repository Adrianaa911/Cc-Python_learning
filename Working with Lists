*Add and remove items from a list using a specific index.
*Create lists with continuous values.
*Get the length of a list.
*Select portions of a list (called slicing).
*Count the number of times that an element appears in a list.
*Sort a list of items.


-- Adding by Index: Insert
The Python list method .insert() allows us to add an element to a specific index in a list.

The .insert() method takes in two inputs:
1.The index you want to insert into.
2.The element you want to insert at the specified index.
The .insert() method will handle shifting over elements and can be used with negative indices.

store_line = ["Karla", "Maxium", "Martim", "Isabella"]
store_line.insert(2, "Vikor")
print(store_line) 

Task:
front_display_list = ["Mango", "Filet Mignon", "Chocolate Milk"]
print(front_display_list)

1. Use .insert() to add "Pineapple" to the front of the list.

front_display_list.insert(0, "Pineapple")
print(front_display_list)

-- Removing by Index: Pop
 Python gives us a method to remove elements at a specific index using a method called .pop().

The .pop() method takes an optional single input: the index for the element you want to remove.

cs_topics = ["Python", "Data Structures", "Balloon Making", "Algorithms", "Clowns 101"]

#First let’s remove "Clowns 101"

removed_element = cs_topics.pop()
print(cs_topics)
print(removed_element)

#Lastly let’s remove "Balloon Making"
cs_topics.pop(2)
print(cs_topics)

Tasks:
data_science_topics = ["Machine Learning", "SQL", "Pandas", "Algorithms", "Statistics", "Python 3"]
print(data_science_topics)

1.Let’s remove the last item from the list of data_science_topics using our newly learned .pop() method.

data_science_topics.pop()
print(data_science_topics)

2. Looks like there is overlap on the "Algorithms" topic as well. Let’s use .pop() to remove it as well.
Print data_science_topics to see the changes.

data_science_topics.pop(-2)
print(data_science_topics)
