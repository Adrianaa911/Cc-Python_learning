Loop Control: Continue
7 min
While the break control statement will come in handy, there are other situations where we donâ€™t want to end the loop entirely. 
What if we only want to skip the current iteration of the loop?

#Loop through the ages list. If an entry is less than 21, skip it and move to the next entry. Otherwise, print() the age.
ages = [12, 38, 34, 26, 21, 19, 67, 41, 17]

for age in ages:
  if age < 21:
    continue
  print(age)
