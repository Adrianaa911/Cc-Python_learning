-- Defining a Function

A function consists of many parts, so let’s first get familiar with its core - a function definition.

Here’s an example of a function definition:

def function_name():
  # functions tasks go here


There are some key components we want to note here:

The def keyword indicates the beginning of a function (also known as a function header). The function header is followed by a name in snake_case format that describes the task the function performs. 
It’s best practice to give your functions a descriptive yet concise name.
Following the function name is a pair of parenthesis ( ) that can hold input values known as parameters (more on parameters later in the lesson!). In this example function, we have no parameters.
A colon : to mark the end of the function header.
Lastly, we have one or more valid python statements that make up the function body (where we have our python comment).

Here is an example of a function that greets a user for our trip planning application:

def trip_welcome():
  print("Welcome to Tripcademy!") 
  print("Let's get you to your destination.")

--calling a function
Now that we’ve practiced defining a function, let’s learn about calling a function to execute the code within its body.

def directions_to_timesSq():
  print("Walk 4 mins to 34th St Herald Square train station.")
  print("Take the Northbound N, Q, R, or W train 1 stop.")
  print("Get off the Times Square 42nd Street stop.")
  print("Take lots of pictures!")
