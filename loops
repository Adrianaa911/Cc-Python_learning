-- For Loops: Using Range

for temp in range(6):
  print("Learning Loops!")   
#output:
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!

for temp in range(6):
  print("Loop is on iteration number " + str(temp + 1))

#Would output:

Loop is on iteration number 1
Loop is on iteration number 2
Loop is on iteration number 3
Loop is on iteration number 4
Loop is on iteration number 5
Loop is on iteration number 6
